===============
Yet another fork of the popular Programming Kata "Gilded Rose Inn". This is an exercise demonstrating how using the IDE to perform solid refactoring.

You are hired by an innkeeper who sells some objects to travellers. Each object has a name, a number of days to sell it (the sellIn) and a quality. For each passing day, items are updated. The update algorithm has been built quite a long time ago, specifications have been lost in dark ages and it is your task to refactor it (prior to add new features or pass an audit). The innkeeper would also like - if you have enough time - to have a cloud ready application so he can monitor items stats on his smartphone.

The initial state is the tag "start". Checkout the branch solution for a possible solution.

Duration: approx 1h.
I was using Maven 3.x, Java 7 and Eclipse (Kepler, on purpose). Will work perfectly on IntelliJ, though I fear I forgot to add configure the gitignore for this IDE.

About code kata
===============
"Pratice makes perfect!" and that is precisely the purpose of code kata: to do again and again small exercises to improve programming skills, discover new idioms, master its tools.
The Gilded Rose Inn is a kata about code refactoring. I saw it performed on IntelliJ and wanted to redo it for my colleagues on Eclipse (Kepler). Here is the result.

Enjoy
